                            Hello! My name is Bhavdeep Singh and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                                San Jose State University</a>.

                        <h4><strong>What do I do and what's in it for you?</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            My goal is to use my skills as a software developer to solve problems. I believe that with my skill set, hard work, determination and tenacity,
                            I will be an asset to your organization<br></br><br></br>
                            <strong>I love solving problems</strong>, whether it's finding out the most effecient way to write a piece of code or finding the 
                            fastest way to beat the next level on a video game. I love the challenge of diving deep into the problem, understanding it and  
                            <em> finding a solution.</em> Perhaps that is why I enjoy playing video games and studying Philosophy in my spare time. <br></br><br></br>
                            I also enjoy my time as a tutor, supplemental instruction leader and mentor. Leading by example, I firmly believe in the phrase
                            "actions speak louder than words" and aim to emoby it with high quality, robust and scalable solutions, as demonstrated in my
